## Why should you care?
Write C# apps with a text editor, nuget and the power of Rosyln!

**Note**: *Roslyn is a pre-release CTP and currently an unsupported technology. As such there may be changes in Roslyn itself that could impact this project. Please bear that in mind when using scriptcs*

* More on why I developed this [here] (http://codebetter.com/glennblock/2013/02/28/scriptcs-living-on-the-edge-in-c-without-a-project-on-the-wings-of-roslyn-and-nuget/)
* Check out our goals and rodmap [here] (https://github.com/scriptcs/scriptcs/wiki/Project-goals-and-roadmap)

## Pre-reqs
* Install scriptcs from Chocolatey `cinst scriptcs` or
* Build the project from the source and put `scriptcs.exe` in your path.

## Quick start
* Open a cmd prompt as admin
* run `scriptcs -install scriptcs.webapi`
* create a `server.csx` with your favorite editor. Paste the text below into the file and save (notice no namespaces & no top level class).

```csharp
public class TestController : ApiController {
  public string Get() {
    return "Hello world!";
  }
}

var webApi = Require<WebApi>();
var server = webApi.CreateServer("http://localhost:8080");
server.OpenAsync().Wait();

Console.WriteLine("Listening...");
Console.ReadKey();
server.CloseAsync().Wait();
```
* run `scriptcs server.csx`

This will launch a web api host with a sample controller, which you can access from the browser.

## How it works
scriptcs relies on Roslyn for loading loose C# script files. It will automatically discover nuget packages local to the app and load the binaries.
