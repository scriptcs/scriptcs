## What is it?

scriptcs makes it easy to write and execute C# with a simple text editor.

While Visual Studio, and other IDEs, are powerful tools, they can sometimes hinder productivity more than they promote it. You donâ€™t always need, or want, the overhead of a creating a new solution or project. Sometimes you want to just type away in your favorite text editor.

scriptcs frees you from Visual Studio, without sacrificing the advantages of a strongly-typed language. 

* Write C# in your favorite text editor.
* Use NuGet to manage your dependencies.
* The relaxed C# scripting syntax means you can write and execute an application with only one line of code. 
* Script Packs allow you to bootstrap the environment for new scripts, further reduces the amount of code necessary to take advantage of your favorite C# frameworks.


## Getting scriptcs

Releases and nightly builds should be installed using [Chocolatey](http://chocolatey.org/). To install Chocolatey, execute the following command in your command prompt:

    @powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Command "iex ((New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))" && SET PATH=%PATH%;%systemdrive%\chocolatey\bin

If the above fails with the error indicating that proxy authentication is required (i.e. [HTTP 407](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.4.8)) then try again with the following on the command prompt that uses your default credentials:

    @powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Command "[Net.WebRequest]::DefaultWebProxy.Credentials = [Net.CredentialCache]::DefaultCredentials; iex ((New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))" && SET PATH=%PATH%;%systemdrive%\chocolatey\bin

**Note:** If you are using a version of Chocolatey > 0.9.9.0 you can pass the `-y` into the install and upgrade commands to prevent the confirmation that will appear.

### Installing scriptcs

Once Chocolatey has been installed, you can install the latest stable version of scriptcs from your command prompt:

    choco install scriptcs

Chocolatey will install scriptcs to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\scriptcs\` and update your PATH accordingly.

**Note:** You may need to restart your command prompt after the installation completes.

### Staying up-to-date

With Chocolatey, keeping scriptcs updated is just as easy:

    choco upgrade scriptcs

**Note:** If you are using a version of Chocolatey < 0.9.0.0 you will need to use `choco update scriptcs`, but also think about updating Chocolatey itself.

### Nightly builds

Nightly builds are hosted on [MyGet](https://www.myget.org/), and can also be installed through with Chocolatey:

    choco install scriptcs -pre -source https://www.myget.org/F/scriptcsnightly/ 

### Building from source

#### Windows

1. Ensure you have .NET Framework 4.5 installed.

1. Execute the build script.

    `build.cmd`

#### Linux

1. Ensure you have Mono development tools 3.0 or later installed.

    `sudo apt-get install mono-devel`

1. Ensure your mono instance has root SSL certificates

    `mozroots --import --sync`
    
1. Execute the build script

    `./build.sh`

## Getting Started

### Using the REPL
The scriptcs REPL can be started by running scriptcs without any parameters. The REPL allows you to execute C# statements directly from your command prompt.

```batchfile
C:\> scriptcs
scriptcs (ctrl-c or blank to exit)

> var message = "Hello, world!";
> Console.WriteLine(message);
Hello, world!
> 

C:\>
```

REPL supports all C# language constructs (i.e. class definition, method definition), as well as multi-line input. For example:

```batchfile
C:\> scriptcs
scriptcs (ctrl-c or blank to exit)

> public class Test {
    public string Name { get; set; }
  }
> var x = new Test { Name = "Hello" };
> x
{Name: "Hello"}

C:\>
```

### Writing a script

* In an empty directory, create a new file named `app.csx`:

```c#
using Raven.Client;
using Raven.Client.Embedded;
using Raven.Client.Indexes;

Console.WriteLine("Starting RavenDB server...");

EmbeddableDocumentStore documentStore = null;
try
{
    documentStore = new EmbeddableDocumentStore { UseEmbeddedHttpServer = true };
    documentStore.Initialize();

    var url = string.Format("http://localhost:{0}", documentStore.Configuration.Port);
    Console.WriteLine("RavenDB started, listening on {0}.", url);

    Console.ReadKey();
}
finally
{
    if (documentStore != null)
        documentStore.Dispose();
}
```

* Install the [RavenDB.Embedded](https://nuget.org/packages/RavenDB.Embedded/) package from NuGet using the [install command](https://github.com/scriptcs/scriptcs/wiki/Package-installation).

```batchfile
scriptcs -install RavenDB.Embedded
```

* Execute your script. Note that listening on a port requires that the command prompt be launched using the **Run as Administrator** option.

```batchfile
> scriptcs app.csx
INFO : Starting to create execution components
INFO : Starting execution
Starting RavenDB server...
.. snip ..
RavenDB started, listening on http://localhost:8080.
```

* Navigating to the URL that Raven is listening on will now bring up the RavenDB management studio.

### Bootstrap scripts with Script Packs

Script Packs can be used to further reduce the amount of code you need to write when working with common frameworks. 

* In an empty directory, install the [ScriptCs.WebApi](https://nuget.org/packages/ScriptCs.WebApi/) script pack from NuGet. The script pack automatically imports the Web API namespaces and provides a convenient factory method for initializing the Web API host. It also replaces the default `ControllerResolver` with a custom implementation that allows Web API to discover controllers declared in scripts.

```batchfile
scriptcs -install ScriptCs.WebApi
```

* Script packs can be imported into a script by calling `Require<TScriptPack>()`. Create a file named `server.csx` that contains the following code:

```c#
public class TestController : ApiController {
    public string Get() {
        return "Hello world!";
    }
}

var webApi = Require<WebApi>();
var server = webApi.CreateServer("http://localhost:8888");
server.OpenAsync().Wait();

Console.WriteLine("Listening...");
Console.ReadKey();
server.CloseAsync().Wait();
```

* In a command prompt running as administrator, execute the `server.csx` file.

```batchfile
scriptcs server.csx 
```

* Browse to http://localhost:8888/test/ to see the result of the TestController.Get method.

```xml
<string xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/">Hello world!</string>
```

### Referencing scripts

* Move the TestController class from the previous example into a new file named `controller.csx` with the following content.

* On the first line of `server.csx`, reference `controller.csx` using the [#load directive](https://github.com/scriptcs/scriptcs/wiki/Writing-a-script#loading-referenced-scripts). **Note:** #load directives must be placed at the top of a script, otherwise they will be ignored.

```c#
#load "controller.csx"
```

* In a command prompt running as administrator, execute the `server.csx` file.

```batchfile
scriptcs server.csx 
```

* Browse to http://localhost:8888/test/ to see the result of the TestController.Get method.

```xml
<string xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/">Hello world!</string>
```


### Referencing assemblies

You can reference additional assemblies from the GAC or from the `bin` folder in your script's directory using the [#r directive](https://github.com/scriptcs/scriptcs/wiki/Writing-a-script#referencing-assemblies):

```c#
#r "nunit.core.dll"
#r "nunit.core.interfaces.dll"

var path = "UnitTests.dll";
var runner = TestSetup.GetRunner(new[] {path});
var result = runner.Run(new ConsoleListener(msg => Console.WriteLine(msg)), TestFilter.Empty, true,     LoggingThreshold.All);

Console.ReadKey();
```

### Debugging

Instructions for debugging scripts using Visual Studio can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/scriptcs/scriptcs/wiki/Debugging-a-script).

### Package installation

You can install any NuGet packages directly from the scriptcs CLI. This will pull the relevant packages from NuGet, and install them in the scriptcs_packages folder.

Once the packages are installed, you can simply start using them in your script code directly (just import the namespaces - no additional bootstrapping or DLL referencing is needed).

The `install` command will also create a `scriptcs_packages.config` file if you don't have one - so that you can easily redistribute your script (without having to copy the package binaries).

 - `scriptcs -install {package name}` will install the desired package from NuGet. 
 	
	For example: 

		scriptcs -install ServiceStack
		
 - `scriptcs -install` (without package name) will look for the `scriptcs_packages.config` file located in the current execution directory, and install all the packages specified there. You only need to specify **top level** packages.

For example, you might create the following `scriptcs_packages.config`:

	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
	<packages>
  		<package id="Nancy.Hosting.Self" version="0.16.1" targetFramework="net40" />
  		<package id="Nancy.Bootstrappers.Autofac" version="0.16.1" targetFramework="net40" />
  		<package id="Autofac" version="2.6.3.862" targetFramework="net40" />
	</packages>

And then just call:

    scriptcs -install

As a result, all packages specified in the `scriptcs_packages.config`, including all dependencies, will be downloaded and installed in the `scriptcs_packages` folder.
